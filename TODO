* ViewSlider2 position not persisted on rotation.
  - probably since ViewPager2 saves and restores it, but when
    restored, there are no images in the slider.

* Scope coroutines properly w.r.t. the Activity/Fragments.
  - can implement CoroutineScope and call its clear() from appropriate event
    - which event?
    - need to set coroutineContext property too, but to what?

* MLKit
  - configure to start download of model at install time
  - wait for model to download when necessary
    - after first need model
  - will need INTERNET permission for model download
  - use appropriately-sized images for feature recognition
  - would need something else for image processing.

* Show merged photo.

* Better unit tests.

* If wipe AVD data, camera app doesn't send photo back to app first time use it.

* Garbage collect files after delete them and UI has finished updating.
  - when ViewPager2 stops using them
    - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.RecyclerListener.html?
  - on startup, in case app shuts down or crashes before can delete files
    - add database index for file column so can query if it is used
  - don't remove images that camera Intent has created but that aren't yet store in the db.

* Handle rejected permissions.

* Better appName.

* Image-deletion dialogue dismissed if rotate device.
  - use androidx DialogFragment?

* Toggleable overlay showing debug info.

* If possible, stop camera app asking for location permission.

* What happens if Camera app isn't given location permission?
