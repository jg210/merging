* Set of images isn't updated after delete an image unless restart app.

* Should findById be suspend function?

* Does ImageViewModel need to connect up with fragment / activity lifecycle?

* Recycled Image ids break PagerView2.
  - if delete image and then take new on, ImageFragment for old image is reused
    - since id is same?
  - compose image filenames of id and then uuid?
    - id for ordering
    - uuid so can add a proper equals() to Image.
    - ...and then implement DiffUtil.Callback using ==.

* Don't delete image until it's gone from the UI.
  - otherwise, rely on no redraws and fresco cachess when shouldn't
  => - need to persist list of images separately from the files
     - need to garbage collect files

* MLKit?
  - configure to start download of model at install time
  - wait for model to download when necessary
    - after first need model
  - will need INTERNET permission for model download
  - use appropriately-sized images for feature recognition
  - would need something else for image processing.

* opencv?

* Full landscape/portrait support.

* Show merged photo.

* Better unit tests.

* If wipe AVD data and deny location permission, then camera app doesn't send photo back to app.

* Handle app rejected permissions.

* Replace launcher icons.
  - Rubin's vase.

* Better app_name.

* Toggleable overlay showing debug info.

* If possible, stop camera app asking for location permission.

* What happens if Camera app isn't given location permission?

* Save apk as artifact on CircleCI.

* Test app on Firebase.
  - https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-android/#testing-with-firebase-test-lab

* Configure android lint
  - tune priorities.
  - make CircleCI fail.

* Spotbugs.

* Show licence texts.
  - extra ViewPager screen would be simplest
  - https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin
  - https://github.com/cookpad/license-tools-plugin
  - https://plugins.gradle.org/search?term=license

* Publish to store.

* Firebase analytics.

* Crash reporting tool.

* Return FragmentStatePagerAdapter.POSITION_UNCHANGED from PagerAdapter in more cases.
  - for better performance when delete photo
  - keep Fragments in sparse ArrayList
  - find length of common prefix of old and new List<File>
  - only keep this many Fragments in the ArrayList

* Persistent ViewPager state.
  - persists across rotations etc., but not full restarts.
