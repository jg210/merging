* ViewSlider2 position not persisted on rotation.

  - can implement CoroutineScope and call its clear() from appropriate event
    - which event?
    - need to set coroutineContext property too, but to what?

* MLKit
  - configure to start download of model at install time
  - wait for model to download when necessary
