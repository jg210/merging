* Does ImageViewModel need to connect up with fragment / activity lifecycle?

* Need to garbage collect files after delete them and UI has finished updating.
  - when ViewPager2 stops using them
    - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.RecyclerListener.html?
  - on startup, in case app shuts down or crashes before can delete files
    - add database index for file column so can query if it is used

* MLKit?
  - configure to start download of model at install time
  - wait for model to download when necessary
    - after first need model
  - will need INTERNET permission for model download
  - use appropriately-sized images for feature recognition
  - would need something else for image processing.

* opencv?

* Full landscape/portrait support.

* Show merged photo.

* Better unit tests.

* If wipe AVD data and deny location permission, then camera app doesn't send photo back to app.

* Handle app rejected permissions.

* Replace launcher icons.
  - Rubin's vase.

* Better app_name.

* Image-deletion dialogue dismissed if rotate device.
  - use androidx DialogFragment?

* Toggleable overlay showing debug info.

* If possible, stop camera app asking for location permission.

* What happens if Camera app isn't given location permission?

* Save apk as artifact on CircleCI.

* Test app on Firebase.
  - https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-android/#testing-with-firebase-test-lab

* Configure android lint
  - tune priorities.
  - make CircleCI fail.

* Spotbugs.

* Show licence texts.
  - extra ViewPager screen would be simplest
  - https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin
  - https://github.com/cookpad/license-tools-plugin
  - https://plugins.gradle.org/search?term=license

* Publish to store.

* Firebase analytics.

* Crash reporting tool.

* Return FragmentStatePagerAdapter.POSITION_UNCHANGED from PagerAdapter in more cases.
  - for better performance when delete photo
  - keep Fragments in sparse ArrayList
  - find length of common prefix of old and new List<File>
  - only keep this many Fragments in the ArrayList

* Persistent ViewPager state.
  - persists across rotations etc., but not full restarts.
