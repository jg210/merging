* CircleCI needs an upload key.

* Automated version-number generation.

* Create release branch.

* Find a face in images.
  X use appropriately-sized images for feature recognition
  - break implementation into separate functions
  - scale images in a way that allows coordinate transforms to be known and aspect ratio to be preserved
  - allow multiple faces per image or just use first one?
  - store contour coordinates in database
    - https://proandroiddev.com/android-room-handling-relations-using-livedata-2d892e40bd53
    - delete if image deleted
  - wait for MLKit model to download when necessary
  - face-detection code doesn't belong in ImageFragment
  - render coordinates on top of images
    - subscribe to data at lowest level
      => in ImageFragment

* ViewSlider2 position not persisted on rotation.
  - probably since ViewPager2 saves and restores it, but when restored, there are no images in the slider.
  - stop ViewPager2 persisting position itself and persist ViewPager2 id in ViewModel instead
    - observe LiveData<MainActivityState>
    - same problem is moved into code that sets up this LiveData
  - keep hold of restored state and use it for first images update?

* Show merged photo.

* Screenshots in github.

* Add bullet points to onboarding text
    - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/style/BulletSpan

* Better unit tests.

* If wipe AVD data, camera app doesn't send photo back to app first time use it.

* Garbage collect files after delete them and UI has finished updating.
  - when ViewPager2 stops using them
    - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.RecyclerListener.html?
  - on startup, in case app shuts down or crashes before can delete files
    - add database index for file column so can query if it is used
  - don't remove images that camera Intent has created but that aren't yet store in the db.

* Handle rejected permissions.

* Skip OnboardingActivity if it's been seen before.
  - showing it again if text changes.
    - a local database of versions already seen.
    - no ordering of versions.

* Add "I agree" checkbox to OnboardingActivity.
  - https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/google-prominent-disclosure-requirement/

* Better appName.

* Image-deletion dialogue dismissed if rotate device.
  - use androidx DialogFragment?

* Toggleable overlay showing debug info.

* If possible, stop camera app asking for location permission.

* What happens if Camera app isn't given location permission?

* Test app on Firebase.
  - https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-android/#testing-with-firebase-test-lab

* Add Firebase Analytics events.
  - https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/android/start
  - enabled only in release builds.

* Choose colour scheme for app.
  - various things are using @color resources directly, not theme attributes...

* Material design
  - implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0'
  - don't misuse dark/light primary color resources
  - Floating Action Button should be in fixed position and fade in/out of view as swipe (if remove it from merged image screen)
  - animate the FAB as switch activities.

* GDPR.

* Automated licence report.
  - listed by licence type.
  - jk1?

* Configure android lint
  - tune priorities.
  - make CircleCI fail.

* android lint says need a backup_descriptor.xml

* kotlin doesn't use java-style capitalization for CONSTANTS.

* Version number screen.

* Why wasn't it possible to get coroutine scope like this?
  - https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#lifecyclescope
  - had to implement CoroutineScope in ImageFragment instead, which is OK, but not as clear

* Explain need INTERNET permission for model download in app blurb.

* Move features in this list to github issues.

* Spotbugs.

* "API 'variant.getMergeResources()' is obsolete" gradle sync warning.

* Publish to store.
  - https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/launch-checklist

* AndroidManifest says app suports RTL.
  - is that correct?
